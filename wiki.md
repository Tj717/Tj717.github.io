# U-District Elevation
I'm discovering the possibilities of creating an elevation map, building off of [this map](https://en-us.topographic-map.com/maps/na3/Seattle/), and maybe showing something interesting about the U-District area.

## Idea One
**Navigation**. To see if elevation affects apps like Google Map's route recommendation

## Idea Two
**Precipatation**. Map of precipatation along with elevation levels. 

## Idea Three
**Contour Map**. 3D visualization of the elevation.
