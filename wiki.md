# U-District Elevation
### I'm discovering the possibilities of creating an elevation map, building off of <a href="https://en-us.topographic-map.com/maps/na3/Seattle">this map</a>, and maybe showing something interesting about the U-District area.

* Ideas
    * One: **Navigation**. To see if elevation affects apps like Google Map's route recommendation

    </p>

    * Two: **Precipatation**. <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2015/10/15/map-of-the-week-rainfall-across-seattle-neighborhoods">Map of precipatation</a> and a a layer of   elevation levels.

    </p>

    * Three: **Contour Map**. 3D visualization of the elevation.
